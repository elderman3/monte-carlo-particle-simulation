# Monte-Carlo-Particle-Simulation

This repository contains the code written for the course Programming Course on Monte Carlo Particle Transport Simulations, where the goal is to create a funcitonal Monte Carlo transport simulation with physically accurate simulation and geometry routines. 
The end goal of the course was to simulate a given nuclear reactor.
